# deep-variable
deep_variable is a lightweight, zero-dependency Python utility designed to eliminate "KeyError" and "TypeError" crashes when working with deeply nested data structures (JSON, dictionaries, and lists). It allows developers to access, check, and modify data using a simple "dot-notation" string path.
